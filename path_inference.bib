review of algos. probabilistic algorithms assume simplistic pdfs (ellipsoids or boxes). Still HF, DBNs.
big mistakes: separates simplistic DBNs (ellipsoids) from 'advanced' ones: particle filters, EKF, etc
use of geometric features of the road (curves, etc) => we can do it.
biggest metric: link identification: seems very crude, especially given how intersection are modelled
in our case: no threshold values
problem at intersections: very crude heuristic proposed. our method gives a lot of various trade-offs to answer it.

Uses A*

Uses heading information
spMM : shortest-path aided map matching
Existing map-matching algorithms that utilize road segment connectivity along with other data (i.e. position, speed and heading) are primarily suitable for high frequency (1Hz or higher) positioning data. While applying these algorithms to low frequency data such as data from a fleet of buses or light duty vehicles, the performance of these algorithms reduces significantly in terms of correct link identification. Such a performance may not be suitable for some real-time Intelligent Transport System (ITS) applications such as estimating link travel time from low frequency GPS data. Therefore, this paper develops a weight-based shortest path aided map-matching (spMM) algorithm that enhances the map-matching process of low frequency data. The well-known A* search algorithm is employed to derive the shortest path between two consecutive fixes while considering link connectivity and turn restriction at junctions. In the developed spMM algorithm, two additional weights related to the shortest path along with the 
two weights (i.e. proximity and bearing difference) commonly used in existing map-matching algorithms are employed. One additional weight is related to the distance along the shortest path and the distance along the vehicle trajectory. The other additional weight is associated with the heading information derived from the shortest path and the vehicle trajectory. The developed spMM algorithm has been tested using a series of real-world dataset of varying frequencies (i.e. 1Hz, 0.2Hz, 0.033Hz and 0.0167Hz). A high accuracy integrated navigation system (a high-grade INS and a carrier-phase GPS receiver) has used to measure the performance of the developed algorithm. The results suggest that the spMM algorithm identifies 97.5% of the links correctly for all frequencies. Without the information from the shortest path, the performance of the algorithm reduces to in the region of 70% in terms of correct link identification. The results also suggest that the algorithm is suitable for real-time applications.

abstract = "The digital map of road networks is one of the most important components in-vehicle navigation. However, existing digital maps do not provide detailed modeling of complex intersections. Therefore, the positioning data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) cannot be properly matched with the road network data at intersections, which may result in navigation errors. To solve this problem, this article develops an improved virtual intersection model for vehicle navigation at intersections. The main conception of the model is to develop a track road to approximate the real travelling trajectory in the intersection. We consider the model in two levels: the All Directional Virtual Intersection (ADVI) model for organizing the digital map data and the Single Directional Virtual Intersection (SDVI) model for real-time navigation. First, considering the features of intersections in the real road network, the ADVI model is proposed based on the existing Kiwi model, which is a specialized format for real-
time vehicle navigation. The track roads are developed to describe the geometric details of an intersection. In addition, the topological structure is built to form an integrated network. Second, the SDVI model for real-time navigation is proposed. It is a simple form of the ADVI model and is easy to build. Then, we present the detailed methods for calculating the SDVI model. A serial of comparison tests were performed to evaluate the SDVI model. The results show that the proposed model can reduce mismatches significantly for intersections with varying complexities in the real road network, especially for those complex ones. Using this model, vehicle navigation can be performed more continuously and reliably at intersections."
