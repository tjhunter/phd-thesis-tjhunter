  title = {On Kinematic Waves. {II.} {A} Theory of Traffic Flow on Long Crowded Roads},
  volume = {229},
  abstract = {This paper uses the method of kinematic waves, developed in part I, but may be read independently. A functional relationship between flow and concentration for traffic on crowded arterial roads has been postulated for some time, and has experimental backing (section 2). From this a theory of the propagation of changes in traffic distribution along these roads may be deduced (section Section 2, 3). The theory is applied (section 4) to the problem of estimating how a 'hump', or region of increased concentration, will move along a crowded main road. It is suggested that it will move slightly slower than the mean vehicle speed, and that vehicles passing through it will have to reduce speed rather suddenly (at a 'shock wave') on entering it, but can increase speed again only very gradually as they leave it. The hump gradually spreads out along the road, and the time scale of this process is estimated. The behaviour of such a hump on entering a bottleneck, which is too narrow to admit the increased 
flow, is studied (section 5), and methods are obtained for estimating the extent and duration of the resulting hold-up. The theory is applicable principally to traffic behaviour over a long stretch of road, but the paper concludes (section 6) with a discussion of its relevance to problems of flow near junctions, including a discussion of the starting flow at a controlled junction. In the introductory sections 1 and 2, we have included some elementary material on the quantitative study of traffic flow for the benefit of scientific readers unfamiliar with the subject.},

  abstract = {The growing need of the driving public for accurate traffic information has spurred the deployment of large scale dedicated monitoring infrastructure systems, which mainly consist in the use of inductive loop detectors and video cameras. On-board electronic devices have been proposed as an alternative traffic sensing infrastructure, as they usually provide a cost-effective way to collect traffic data, leveraging existing communication infrastructure such as the cellular phone network. A traffic monitoring system based on {GPS-enabled} smartphones exploits the extensive coverage provided by the cellular network, the high accuracy in position and velocity measurements provided by {GPS} devices, and the existing infrastructure of the communication network. This article presents a field experiment nicknamed Mobile Century, which was conceived as a proof of concept of such a system. Mobile Century included 100 vehicles carrying a {GPS-enabled} Nokia N95 phone driving loops on a 10-mile stretch of I-
880 near Union City, California, for 8 h. Data were collected using virtual trip lines, which are geographical markers stored in the handset that probabilistically trigger position and speed updates when the handset crosses them. The proposed prototype system provided sufficient data for traffic monitoring purposes while managing the privacy of participants. The data obtained in the experiment were processed in real-time and successfully broadcast on the internet, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed system for real-time traffic monitoring. Results suggest that a 2-3\% penetration of cell phones in the driver population is enough to provide accurate measurements of the velocity of the traffic flow. Data presented in this article can be downloaded from http://traffic.berkeley.edu.},

  title = {Delay Pattern Estimation for Signalized Intersections Using
Sampled Travel Times},
  abstract = {Intersection delays are the major contributing factor to arterial delays. In this article, we study
methods to estimate intersection delay patterns using measured travel times. The delay patterns
provide a way to estimate the delay for any vehicle arriving at the intersection at any time, which
is very useful for providing time-dependent intersection delay information to the driving public.
The model requires sampled travel times between two consecutive locations on arterial streets,
most likely upstream and downstream of a signalized intersection, without the need to know signal
timing or traffic flow information. Signal phases can actually be estimated from the delay patterns,
which is a unique feature of the proposed method in this paper. The proposed model is based
on two observations regarding delays for signalized intersections: 1) delay can be approximately
represented by piecewise linear curves due to the characteristics of queue forming and discharging
before a signalized intersection, and 2) there is a non-trivial increase in delay after the start of the
red time, which enables us to detect the start of a cycle. We then develop a least square based
estimation algorithm to match measured delays in each cycle using piecewise linear curves. The
proposed model and algorithm are tested using field experiment data with reasonable results.},

@techreport{drf-techreport,
    Abstract = {This paper investigates how different resources can be fairly allocated among users that possibly prioritize them differently. We introduce a fairness policy, called Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), which is an adaptation of max-min fairness from networking to datacenter environments. We show that DRF, unlike other policies which we investigated, satisfies a number of desirable properties that a fair datacenter scheduler should have, including guaranteeing that every user gets 1/N of some resource and that users can relinquish resources without hurting other users' allocations. DRF is also envy-free, incentivizing users to correctly report their resource demand. When compared to other intuitive schedulers, as well as competing ones from microeconomic theory, DRF is more fair.},

@inproceedings{mapreduce,
    Abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets.  Users specify a \_map\_ function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a \_reduce\_ function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.  Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper. <P> Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program's execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter- machine communication.  This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system.  <P> Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is 
highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day.     <P>},
