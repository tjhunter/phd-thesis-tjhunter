  abstract = {On the heels of compressed sensing, a new field has very recently
	emerged. This field addresses a broad range of problems of significant
	practical interest, namely, the recovery of a data matrix from what
	appears to be incomplete, and perhaps even corrupted, information.
	In its simplest form, the problem is to recover a matrix from a small
	sample of its entries. It comes up in many areas of science and engineering,
	including collaborative filtering, machine learning, control, remote
	sensing, and computer vision, to name a few. This paper surveys the
	novel literature on matrix completion, which shows that under some
	suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix from
	a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization
	problem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints.
	Further, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix
	completion is provably accurate even when the few observed entries
	are corrupted with a small amount of noise. A typical result is that
	one can recover an unknown matrix of low rank from just about log
	noisy samples with an error that is proportional to the noise level.
	We present numerical results that complement our quantitative analysis
	and show that, in practice, nuclear-norm minimization accurately
	fills in the many missing entries of large low-rank matrices from
	just a few noisy samples. Some analogies between matrix completion
	and compressed sensing are discussed throughout.},
