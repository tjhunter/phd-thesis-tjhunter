Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GPS receivers have enjoyed a widespread use in transportation and they are
 rapidly becoming a commodity.
 They offer unique capabilities for tracking fleets of vehicles (for companies),
 and routing and navigation (for individuals).
 These receivers are usually attached to a car or a truck, also called a
 
\emph on
probe vehicle
\emph default
, and they relay information to a base station using the data channels of
 cellphone networks (3G, 4G).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the common problems which occurs when dealing with GPS traces is
 the correct mapping of these observations to the road network, and the
 reconstruction of the trajectory of the vehicle.
 We present a new class of algorithms, called the 
\emph on
path inference filter, 
\emph default
that solves this problem in a principled and efficient way.
 Specific instantiations of this algorithm have been deployed as part of
 the 
\emph on
Mobile Millennium
\emph default
 system, which is a traffic estimation and prediction system developed at
 the University of California

A typical datum provided by a probe vehicle includes an identifier of the
 vehicle, a (noisy) position and a timestamp

The experiments in this dissertation use GPS observations only.
 However, nothing prevents the application of the algorithms presented in
 this dissertation to other types of localized data.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The two most important characteristics of GPS data for traffic estimation
 purposes are the GPS localization accuracy and the sampling strategy followed
 by the probe vehicle.
 In order to reduce power consumption or transmission costs, probe vehicles
 do not continuously report their location to the base station.
 The probe data currently available are generated using a combination of
 the two following strategies:

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 These landmarks are usually laid over some predetermined route followed
 by drivers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Temporal sampling
\emph default
: GPS probes send their position at fixed rate.
 The critical factor is then the 
\emph on
temporal resolution 
\emph default
of the probe data.
 A low temporal resolution carries some uncertainty as to which trajectory
 was followed.
 A high temporal resolution gives access to the complete and precise trajectory
 of the vehicle.
 However, the device usually consumes more power and communication bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of a high temporal resolution (typically, a frequency greater
 than an observation per second), some highly successful methods have been
 developed for continuous estimation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "thrun2002probabilistic,miwa2004route,du2004lane"

\end_inset

.
 However, most data collected at large scale today is generated by commercial
 fleet vehicles.
 It is primarily used for tracking the vehicles and usually has a low temporal
 resolution (1 to 2 minutes) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "navteq,inrix,telenav,cabspotting"

\end_inset

.
 In the span of a minute, a vehicle in a city can cover several blocks.
 Therefore, information on the precise path followed by the vehicle is lost.
 Furthermore, due to GPS localization errors, recovering the location of
 a vehicle that just sent an observation is a non trivial task: there are
 usually several roads that could be compatible with any given GPS observation.
 Simple deterministic algorithms to reconstruct trajectories fail due to
 misprojection (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:failure_shortest_path"

\end_inset

) or shortcuts (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:failure_shortest_proj"

\end_inset

).
 Such shortcomings have motivated our search for a principled approach that
 jointly considers the mapping of observations to the network and the reconstruc
tion of the trajectory.
\end_layout

The problem of mapping data points onto a map can be traced back to 1980

 Researchers started systematic studies after the introduction of the GPS
 system to civilian applications in the 1990s 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 These early approaches followed a

 perspective, associating each observation datum to some point in the network
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Later, this projection technique was refined to use more information such
 as heading and road curvature.
 This greedy matching, however, leads to poor trajectory reconstruction
 since it does not consider the path leading up to a point

 New deterministic algorithms emerged to directly match partial trajectories
 to the road by using the topology of the network

 and topological metrics based on the Fr√©chet distance

\begin_layout Standard
Two types of information are missing in a sequence of GPS readings: the
 exact location of the vehicle on the road network when the observation
 was emitted, and the path followed from the previous location to the new
 location.
 These problems are correlated.
 The aforementioned approaches focus on high-frequency sampling observations,
 for which the path followed is extremely short (less than a few hundred
 meters, with very few intersections).
 In this context, there is usually a dominant path that starts from a well-defin
ed point, and Bayesian filters accurately reconstruct paths from observations

.
 When sampling rates are lower and observed points are further apart, however,
 a large number of paths are possible between two points.
 Researchers have recently focused on efficiently identifying these correct
 paths and have separated the joint problem of finding the paths and finding
 the projections into two distinct problems.
 The first problem is path identification and the second step is projection
 matching

 scheme have also recently been proposed

As will be seen in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In the present discussion, we restrict ourselves to a class of models (the
 exponential family distributions) that is rich enough to provide insight
 on the driving patterns of the vehicles.
 Furthermore, when using this class of models, the learning of new parameters
 leads to a convex problem formulation that is fast to solve.
 These parameters can be learned using standard Machine Learning algorithms,
 even when no ground truth is available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
With careful engineering, it is possible to achieve high throughput on large-sca
le networks.
 Our reference implementation achieves an average throughput of hundreds
 of GPS observations per second on a single core in real time.
 Furthermore, the algorithm scales well on multiple cores and has achieved
 average throughput of several thousands of points per second on a multicore
 architecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Algorithms often need to trade off accuracy for timeliness, and are considered
 either

 The path inference filter is designed to work across the full spectrum
 of accuracy versus latency.
 As we will show, we can still achieve good accuracy by delaying computations
 by only one or two time steps.
 We will also present an offline variation of the algorithm that performs
 full trajectory reconstruction with high throughput (at the expense of
 latency).

 Due to noise in the observation, the point at
