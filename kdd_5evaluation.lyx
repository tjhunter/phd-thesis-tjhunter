\begin_layout Standard
The article presents an algorithm to turn GPS traces from a small fraction
 of the vehicles traveling on the road network into valuable traffic information
 to develop large scale traffic information platforms and optimal and robust
 routing capabilities.
 The value of the model depends crucially on the quality of the estimates
 of point to point travel time distribution.
 Another key feature of the algorithm is its computational complexity and
 its ability to scale on large road networks.
 The large number of road segments and intersections leads to high-dimensional
 problems for any network of reasonable size.
 Moreover, the estimate for travel time distributions between any two points
 on the network needs to be computed in real-time.
 It would not be acceptable to wait more than a few seconds to get the results.
 This section first analyzes the quality of the learning and the estimation
 of the model.
 Then, we study the computational complexity of the algorithm and its ability
 to scale on large networks.
 In particular, some aspects of the algorithm arise as trade-offs between
 the computational complexity and the desired precision in the learning
 and real-time inference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The validation results are based on anonymized GPS traces provided by a
 GPS data aggregator.
 We consider an arterial network in the Bay Area of San Francisco, CA with
 506,585 links.
 The algorithm processes 426 million GPS points, aggregated from 2,640,319
 individual trajectories.
 Each trajectory is less than 20 minutes long for privacy reasons.

\begin_layout Standard
The full validation of the performance of the algorithm requires the observation
 of the travel time of every vehicle on every link of the network.
 This mode of validation is unfortunately not available for any reasonably
 sized network.
 We validate the learning capabilities of the algorithm using data which
 was not used to train the HMM and GMRF.
 On this validation dataset, we perform two types of validation: (i) a path-leve
l validation (a limited set of individual paths are evaluated) and (ii)
 a network-level validation (metrics taken over the entire validation dataset).

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Path validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most probe vehicles have different paths throughout the road network.
 Among the trajectories of the vehicles in the validation set, we select
 a set of paths for which a large enough number of vehicles has traveled
 to perform statistical validation of the distribution of travel times.
 We impose a minimum length (set to 150 m in the numerical experiments)
 on these paths to ensure that we validate the learning of the spatial distribut
ions of the modes (Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) and the spatial correlations between each mode (Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 The paths are selected for having the largest amount of validation data.

We notice a significant difference in the results between the uni-modal
 models (
\shape italic
One mode
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
One mode independent
\shape default
) and the multi-modal models (
\shape italic
Multi-modal independent
\shape default
, 
\shape italic

\shape default
).
 The uni-modal models tend to over-estimate both the median and the variance
 of travel times.
 These models cannot account for the difference of travel times due to stops
 on trajectories, which is one of the main features of arterial traffic
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The over-estimated variance illustrates why it is important to incorporate
 the variability of travel times due to stops in the structure of the model.
 On the other side, the multi-modal models are able to capture the features
 of the distribution fairly accurately.
 The differences in accuracy between the 
\shape italic
Multi-modal independent
\shape default
 model and the MM-GMRF model (which takes into account correlations in the
 Gaussian distribution) are not significant, even though the model with
 correlations estimates the variability slightly more accurately.
 It seems that capturing the variability of travel times due to stop is
 the most important feature of the model.

Network scale validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most points in the observation dataset represent different paths for the
 probe vehicles.
 For this reason, the distributions cannot be compared directly.
 Instead, we compute the log-likelihood of each validation path and analyze
 the quality of the travel time bounds provided by the distribution for
 each path.

 a) displays the average likelihood of the validation paths computed by
 the different models.
 The figure also analyzes how the path length influences the results.
 There are two motivations for doing so: (i) the length of the path influences
 the support of the distribution (longer paths are expected to have a larger
 support) which may affect the likelihood and (ii) the different models
 may perform differently on different lengths as they do not take into account
 spatial dependencies in a similar way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As was expected from the analysis of Figures

 and

, the multi-modal models perform better than their uni-modal counterparts.
 Compared to the path validation results, the figure shows more significantly
 the effect of correlations.
 The figure shows slight improvements for the multi-modal model which takes
 into account the correlations.
 Surprisingly, the contrary is true for the uni-modal models.
 We also notice that the likelihood decreases with the length of the path,
 as we were expecting.

 b) analyzes the quality of the travel time distribution computed on the
 network.
 For that, we use a 
\emph on
p-p plot
\emph default
 (or percentile-percentile plot) which assesses how much each learned distributi
on matches the validation data.
 To each path 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 in the validation dataset corresponds an inverse cumulative distribution
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{p}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 (computed from the trained model) and a travel time observation 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{p}$
\end_inset

.
 A point 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha,\beta)$
\end_inset

 on the curve corresponds to having 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 percent of the validation points such that 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{p}\leq P_{p}^{-1}(\alpha)$
\end_inset

.
 If the estimation was perfect, there would be exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

% of the data points in the percentile 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 To quantify how much each model deviates from perfect estimation, we display
 two metrics denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 (above) and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 (below).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 correspond to the p-p curve of a model, the corresponding metrics are computed
 as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a=\int_{0}^{1}\max(f(\alpha)-\alpha,0)\, d\alpha\,,\, b=\int_{0}^{1}\max(\alpha-f(\alpha),0)\, d\alpha
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These values provide insight on the quality of the fit of the model.
 For example, a model with a large 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

-value tends to overestimate travel times.
 Similarly, a model with a large 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

-value tends to underestimate travel times.
 Both uni-modal models have large 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

-values.
 The large variance estimated by the models (already noticed in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eval:scatter"

\end_inset

) to account for the variability of travel times leads to non-negligible
 probability densities for small travel times which are not physically possible.
 Compared to the likelihood validation of Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eval:llinterval"

\end_inset

 a), the p-p plot analyzes the quality of fit for different percentiles
 of the distribution.
 In particular, we notice that the effect of capturing the correlations
 in the multi-variate model mostly affects the estimation of the low and
 high percentiles in the distribution.
 We expect that this is due to the fact that correlations accounts for the
 impacts of slow vs.
 fast drivers or congested vs.
 lest congested conditions.

 that the inference is independent from the size of the network).
 We ran the learning for networks defined by different bounding boxes.
 The bounding boxes were adjusted so that the number of links in each subnetwork

 The longest step by far is the training of the GMRF.

 As one can see, the training time increases linearly with the number of
 variables of the GMRF over a large range of network sizes.
 The graphs associated to each GMRF are extremely sparse: the average vertex
