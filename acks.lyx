The clock was ticking with a deadly punctuality at each second, answered
 only by the howling shriek of the coffee machine.
 The fingers were dancing on the keyboards like grains of rice of a drum.
 Pairs of eyes were staring at abstract charts and symbles written in languages
 no one could utter but computers.
 Sometimes, a sentence would drop, more precise than a scalpel in the surgical
 room:

Experiment one is running.
 I changed the value of sigma to 0.2 and reduced the number of machines

 The confirmation would come a second later:

Wait.
 I am compiling
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 Wait.
 The laptops were scrambling to decypher the cryptic instructions that even
 their masters could barely apprehend.
 One hour still before the conference deadline.
 One hour before a small clock announces that it is midnight in the Samoa
 Islands.
 One hour before a digital cerberus decides that the academic styx is closed
 for business until the next year.
 The sweat starts to glue the fingers to their keys.
 Suddenly, the light shuts off, and the pale glow of the emergency light
 weakly warms the room.
 No more electricity.
 No more wifi.
 No more barking from the Samoa cerberus.
 And still seventeen minutes before the deadline.

Doing a phd requires a certain dose of insanity and can seem perilously
 close to skidiving and jungle exploration.
 If I had to put the blame on someone, Pieter Abbeel and his co-conspirator
 Adam Coates would stand high on the list.
